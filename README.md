# Todo List

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and utilizes useState and useEffect hooks to create a basic to-do list application where users add to a list, mark it as complete (triggering the task text to be crossed out), and remove from the task from the list. I ensured that a page refresh would not wipeout the list through the use of localStorage functions.
